# Pneumonia-COVID-classifier
The project included working with CT scan images of patient's lungs to segeregate and classify patients with Pneumonia, COVID-19 and patients who were normal. We achieved an accuracy of 98 percent using an ensemble model (ResNet18, ResNet50 and a hybrid model - MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and gradient boosting classifier for classification)
